## Project Overview

This project analyzes Amazon product sales, ratings, and discount strategies across multiple categories to provide actionable insights for **revenue growth, customer satisfaction, and pricing strategy**.

## Problem Statement

The company sells a wide range of products across multiple categories, but management does not fully understand:  

1. Which product categories perform best or worst in sales and ratings.  
2. How discounts affect customer behavior and product ratings.  
3. Which categories need strategic attention to boost customer satisfaction.  
4. Where the company should allocate marketing, inventory, and pricing efforts.  
5. Whether certain products require quality improvements or discount adjustments.  

The aim is to analyze product performance across sales, ratings, and discount levels to identify actionable opportunities for category optimization, improved pricing strategy, and better customer satisfaction.

## Summary & Recommendations

1. **Prioritize the Electronics Category for Revenue Growth**  
   - Increase stock levels for high-demand subcategories: in-ear headphones, earphones, mobile accessories, smartphones.  
   - Expand product variety in fast-moving accessories (chargers, earbuds, power banks).  
   - Run targeted marketing campaigns for electronics, especially during peak sales periods.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Higher market share in the strongest-performing category.

2. **Use Discount Strategies More Aggressively in Electronics**  
   - Maintain or slightly increase discounts for high-volume electronics to boost conversion.  
   - Introduce limited-time seasonal discounts on new electronics to accelerate adoption.  
   - Bundle offers: e.g., “Buy Earphones + Phone Case” or “Smartphones + Accessories Combo.”  
   **Expected Outcome:** Increased revenue and higher customer satisfaction.

3. **Boost Marketing for Home & Kitchen and Computer Accessories**  
   - Improve product visibility on the homepage and category pages.  
   - Highlight discounts more clearly in search results.  
   - Promote “Best Deals in Home & Kitchen” banners.  
   - Offer combos (e.g., “Keyboard + Mouse + Accessories Pack”).  
   **Expected Outcome:** Improved category balance and overall sales diversification.

4. **Leverage the Strong Reputation of Office Products**  
   - Maintain 0%–low discount strategy — customers will still buy.  
   - Expand product selection in top-rated office subcategories.  
   - Highlight “Top-Rated Office Essentials” in campaigns.  
   - Target schools, institutions, and bulk purchasers with curated collections.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Higher profit margins with minimal discount costs.

5. **Improve Quality and Customer Experience for Car & Motorbike Products**  
   - Conduct a vendor quality review for Car & Motorbike suppliers.  
   - Include more high-quality or premium interior accessories.  
   - Improve product descriptions and customer guides (e.g., “How to Install Car Ionizers”).  
   - Increase discounts slightly to encourage trial if stock turnover is slow.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Improved ratings, reduced returns, and higher trust in the category.

6. **Optimize Discount Ranges Across All Categories**  
   - Use 0.40–0.60% discounts as a baseline strategy across categories.  
   - Test slightly higher discounts (1%–2%) in low-performing categories to boost engagement.  
   - Monitor impact on ratings and conversion weekly.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Improved ratings and customer satisfaction across lower-performing categories.

7. **Use Positive Discount–Rating Relationship to Drive Review Volume**  
   - Launch “discount-for-review” campaigns (ethical, not paid reviews).  
   - Example: “Leave a review and get 2% off your next purchase.”  
   - Use targeted discounts on new or poorly-rated products to boost reviews.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Faster rating accumulation and better social proof for products.

8. **Expand High-Engagement Product Lines**  
   - Introduce premium versions of high-engagement products.  
   - Introduce budget versions for price-sensitive buyers.  
   - Use customer review text to identify missing features or common complaints.  
   **Expected Outcome:** Increased customer loyalty and improved product-market fit.

**Final Summary for Management:**  
- Electronics is the engine of revenue → prioritize and expand.  
- Office Products deliver high ratings with zero discounts → maintain premium status.  
- Car & Motorbike needs immediate quality review and product improvement.  
- Discounting works → use targeted, category-specific discount strategies.  
- Review volume grows with discount → leverage this to build trust and sales.
